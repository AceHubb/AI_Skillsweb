ORPHAN CARD ANALYSIS REPORT
===========================
Total Orphans Found: 50

INSIGHTS & RECOMMENDATIONS
--------------------------
- **Cloud Catalog**: A large number of orphans are specific cloud services. Recommendation: Consolidate under '010_stack_cloud_hosting'.
- **Visual Portfolio**: Many orphans are media/diagrams. Recommendation: Link these to their specific subject matter cards rather than a generic 'Media' stack.
- **Management & Strategy**: There are high-level strategy cards that could form a new 'Executive' trail.
