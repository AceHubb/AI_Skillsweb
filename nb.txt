Prompt: Nuts & Bolts Interactive Playing-Card Stacks

Project Description:
We are building an interactive “Nuts & Bolts” skills section for a professional portfolio website. This section displays a hierarchy of technical skills, tools, and sub-skills as stacks of cards inside a 6×6 modal grid, with the visual style of playing cards stacked.

Core Concept:

Each stack of cards represents a skill hierarchy: vertical ? tool ? sub-skill ? applied projects.

The top card of the stack is fully visible, and clicking it reveals the next card underneath in the stack.

Cards should visually resemble physical playing cards, slightly offset, so the stacked nature is apparent.

Users can drill down through the stack to explore skills without cluttering the screen.

Requirements:

Modal Window:

Opens on “View Skills” click

Covers most of the viewport, dims background

Scrollable if needed, responsive on mobile (vertical stack)

Card Matrix (6×6 grid):

Each cell holds a stack of cards

Front of card: icon/logo, title, teaser bullets

Back of card: detailed description, applied projects, optional sub-skills

Cards flip in place to reveal back content

Visual style: playing-card look (border, subtle shadow, slight tilt offset for stacked cards)

Cascading / Branching Cards (Stacks):

Cards can have children cards, forming a stack

Clicking a card reveals the next card in the stack in the same grid cell or adjacent cell

Example: Database stack ? Oracle card ? PL/SQL card

Each stack can grow dynamically based on JSON content

Diagram Popups:

Cards can have a “View Diagram” button

Clicking opens a secondary modal overlay showing a large diagram

User closes overlay ? returns to stack

UX & Interaction:

Hover/focus: subtle scale-up or shadow

Optional breadcrumbs show stack path (Database ? Oracle ? PL/SQL)

Mobile: convert 6×6 grid into vertical swipeable stacks

JSON Driven:

Each stack is defined in JSON with fields:

cardType: vertical, tool, subSkill

title, icon, teaserBullets, details

childrenCards: array of cards forming the stack

diagram: optional image with popup

UI dynamically renders stacks from JSON
